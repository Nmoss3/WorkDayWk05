## Description

This application is for any user who would like to use a daily planner/schedule to plan out their 9am to 5pm workday. This application tracks the times and when they are in the future, past or current hour of the day. Each duty or task that is entered into the planner will be saved into the users localStorage whenever they click the save button. This allows the useer to shut down during lunch and revisit the page to view the tasks they have previously saved and pick back up where they left off.
